            PhysicsEngine is a library that provides a simple interface for creating physics simulations. It is designed to be easy to use, and to be able to handle a wide range of use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The library is built on top of the popular Matter.js library, which is a powerful and flexible 2D physics engine. Matter.js is a great choice for many applications, but it can be a bit overwhelming to use for simple simulations. PhysicsEngine aims to provide a simpler, more intuitive interface for creating physics simulations, while still providing access to the full power of Matter.js when needed.

        <p>
            PhysicsEngine is still in the early stages of development, but it is already quite capable. It is designed to be easy to install and use, and to be able to handle a wide range of use cases. It is also designed to be extensible, so that it can be easily customized and extended to handle more complex simulations.
